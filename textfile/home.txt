This interface is inspired by the the kisslinux website[1], whole interface in
generated form a text file which is compiled into HTML using regular experience
text file is being parser and at required position is being convert into HTML
which is being routed throung flask package in python, and templating engine is
default of flask, ie., jinja.

originaly the conversion is being done by a make file but i dont want that so i
wrote in in python.

acsii art used in the web page in from acsiiart website[2] do check them out.
